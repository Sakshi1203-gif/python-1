        "  -ans:Python is a high-level, easy-to-learn programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's popular because it's versatile (used in web development, data science, automation, and more), has a large supportive community, and offers a rich set of libraries and frameworks. Its simple syntax, cross-platform compatibility, and ability to handle complex tasks with less code make it a favorite among both beginners and experienced developers."
